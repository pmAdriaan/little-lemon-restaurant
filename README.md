# Little Lemon Restaurant Website

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Little Lemon Restaurant Website repository! This project was developed as part of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course, serving as the culmination of the Front-End Development Track.

The primary focus of this website is to demonstrate the implementation of a booking application within the Little Lemon website. Leveraging React components, the project showcases proficiency in using React to construct a dynamic and responsive user interface. Additionally, the website incorporates API calls to enhance its functionality.

**Note:** Currently, the only operational feature on the website, apart from the design, is the "Reserve a Table" function.
